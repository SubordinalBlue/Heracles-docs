# Configuration
Heracles has a number of points of configuration.

## Changing Ordering of Groups
The `groups.txt` file is in the `config/heracles/` folder.

You can edit this file to change the order in which group names appear in the left sidebar of Heracles main screen.

## Tutorial Screen
The file `tutorial.html`, located in the `config/heracles/` folder, is displayed to the player the first time they open Heracles in-game.

## Configuration File
Heracles' configuration file, `heracles_options.json`, is in the top-level folder of a minecraft instance.

It has three options:

1. `pinnedIndex`

2. `showTutorial`: If this is "true", Heracles will first display the tutorial.html file when Heracles is opened in-game.

3. `maxEditorHistory`: defaults to 100
