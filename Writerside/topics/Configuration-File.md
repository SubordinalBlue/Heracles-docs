# Configuration File

Heracles' configuration file, `heracles_options.json`, is in the top-level folder of a minecraft instance.

It has three options:

1. `pinnedIndex`

2. `showTutorial`: If this is "true", Heracles will display the [`tutorial.html`](Tutorial-html.md) file when it is opened in-game.

3. `maxEditorHistory`: defaults to 100
