# Group View

## For Players

Out-of-the-box, with no quest material and using the built-in theme, Heracles main window, the Group View, looks like this:

Here is an example with some quests in-place and some progress already made(indicated by the colored backgrounds of the quests with the log and map icons).

> The Edit Mode button—the pencil icon just left of the close button (X) top right—will only show when cheats are enabled, or you are in Creative mode, or on servers for players with OP access.

## For Editors

### Buttons
When Edit Mode is active, more buttons are displayed:

From left to right, these buttons are:

- `New Group`: for adding groups.
- `Select` tool: for selecting quests

- `Import`: for importing quest data
- `Edit Mode`: for entering or leaving Edit Mode
- `Exit` for exiting Heracles

### Quest Settings
When a quest is selected in Edit Mode, a panel of options for that quest appears on the right side:

Underneath the `Title`, `Position`, and `Subtitle` boxes, are five "Action" buttons.

From left to right these buttons are:
- `Change Icon`
- `Change Icon Background`
- `Change Dependencies`
- `Delete`
- `Edit Quest Settings`

##### Options for `Hide Until`
`Edit Quest Settings` itself brings up o pop-up box with five settings:

The options for `Hidden Until` may warrant explanation; the rest are fairly self-explanatory

`Hidden Until` options are:
- `Locked`: Always display this quest (don't hide it)
- `In Progess`: Hide until dependencies are completed
- `Completed`: Hide until _this quest itself_ is completed
- `Parents Visible`: Hide this quest until it's dependencies are visible
