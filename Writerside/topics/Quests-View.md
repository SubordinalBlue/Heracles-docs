# Group View

## For Players

Out-of-the-box, with no quest material and using the built-in theme, Heracles main window, the Group View, looks like this:

> The Edit Mode button will only show when in Creative mode or for players with OP access, or when cheats are enabled.
>
> It is the pencil icon button just left of the close button with an X icon, top right.

Here is but one example of what players may see, once quests have been added:

## For Editors

When the Edit Mode button is clicked, Edit Mode becomes active and more buttons are displayed.

From left to right, these buttons are:

- The `New Group` button is for adding groups.
- The `Select` tool is for selecting quests

- The `Import` button is for importing quest data
- The `Edit Mode` button will leave, or enter, Edit Mode
- The `Exit` button always exits Heracles and returns to Minecraft.
